# Motifs_N_ComputerSetup
Write a Python script to evaluate sequence motifs and output the possible orfs in fasta format.

Author: Yaochieh Yao
This code is for assignment 2, Motifs and Computer Set-up of the
BINF6400 Genomic course. The homework requires reading a bacteria
genome as input with contigs, finding the motif score in 13 bases
of each sequence over a threshold of 7.25 to decide the start codon's
position. After that, find all possible open reading frames that end
with a stop codon, write a new fasta file, and evaluate the orfs in
the research question.
